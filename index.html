              Ollie is a brown bear, he loves salmon and enjoys his fair share
              of honey! Ollie was recently rescued from a National Park in the
              midwest where there have been poacher sightings, and he was
              injured. We are currently keeping him for observation as he makes
              his full recovery!

            <p class="animal-description">
              Mona is our second brown bear, she is quite playful and enjoys
              large branches that she can throw around or finding large rocks to
              roll. She is still quite young so she is definitely enjoying her
              youth! Mona is also a rescue, she was rescued from the California
              forest fires that unfortunately caused her to be separated from
              her parents, and now she is here with us making a new family and
              becoming quite close with Ollie.

          Giraffes are the world's tallest mammals, thanks to their towering
          legs and long necks. A giraffe's legs alone are taller than many
          humansâ€”about 6 feet . These long legs allow giraffes to run as fast as
          35 miles an hour over short distances and cruise comfortably at 10
          miles an hour over longer distances.

          Lions are unique among cats in that they live in a group, or pride.
          The members of a pride typically spend the day in several scattered
          groups that may unite to hunt or share a meal. A pride consists of
          several generations of lionesses, some of which are related, a smaller
          number of breeding males, and their cubs.

          The average adult size for a female is 8.2 feet (2.6 meters), and the
          average size for a male is 11.2 feet (3.4 meters). Exceptionally large
          males can reach a weight of nearly half a ton or 1,000 pounds (454
